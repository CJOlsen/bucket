This is a slightly modified version of CoolBlue 2.0.3, in my opinion the BEST
of the WinAmp 2.x skins.  If you use Audacious on GNU/Linux you can use the old 
WinAmp themes to reskin your player.

I couldn't get it to work on my old Debian build but after digging through some
old docs on how to make WinAmp 2.x skins I removed a thing or two - I think the 
super cool blue cursor (may have to fix this some day) and something else I 
can't remember at the moment.  I'm not the author of the skin, I believe that to
be Scott Riemann, nor am I claiming to own it or license it or anything like
that.

You can unzip the .wsz file to take a look inside, it's fun to peek at the old
customization culture around the year 2000.

My .conkyrc file matches this skin, it looks nice with a dark background...

note ():
" This is my second skin for WinAmp 2.X. I really like this skin. It makes my other skin 'Winamp - Core' look really whimpy. But I feel that this skin is stil missing something, oh well. My next creation I have no clue when it will be up, but I do know that it will be the official skin of DarkMazda's Domain, since DarkMazda has been bugging me for one. "
